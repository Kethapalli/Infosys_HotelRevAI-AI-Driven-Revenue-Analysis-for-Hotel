📐 DAX Measures

1️⃣ Rooms Sold

Rooms Sold = SUM ( Bookings[Rooms Booked] )

2️⃣ Rooms Available

Rooms Available = SUM ( Hotels[Total Rooms] )

3️⃣ Occupancy %

Occupancy % = DIVIDE ( [Rooms Sold], [Rooms Available], 0 )

4️⃣ Total Revenue

Total Revenue = SUM ( Bookings[Revenue] )

5️⃣ Average Daily Rate (ADR)

ADR = DIVIDE ( [Total Revenue], [Rooms Sold], 0 )

6️⃣ Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)

RevPAR = DIVIDE ( [Total Revenue], [Rooms Available], 0 )

DAX Measures

Direct Revenue = CALCULATE ( [Total Revenue], Bookings[Booking Source] = "Direct" )

OTA Revenue = CALCULATE ( [Total Revenue], Bookings[Booking Source] = "OTA"

🎛️ Interactive Slicers

Implemented slicers for:

Room Type

Hotel Branch / Location

Date Range

All slicers interact dynamically with all visuals.

👥 Guest Classification Metrics

Guest Measures

Total Bookings per Guest = COUNT ( Bookings[Booking_ID] )

Total Spend per Guest = SUM ( Bookings[Revenue] )

Guest Segmentation Column

Guest Segment = SWITCH ( TRUE(), [Total Spend per Guest] >= 50000, "High Spender", [Total Bookings per Guest] >= 3, "Loyal Guest", [Total Bookings per Guest] = 1, "First-time Guest", "Regular Guest" )
